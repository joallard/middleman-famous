Jon's Middleman Template
========================
This is Jon's Middleman template. It is Middleman bundled with
Foundation4, using HAML. It also uses some goodies like Livereload 
and a Google Analytics snippet.  There is no content by default. Because
it annoys me.

## (The same, in readable) Bullet points!
* Middleman
* Foundation 4
* HAML
* Livereload
* No content (annoying)
* Google Analytics

## Usage
### Install

    $ git clone git://github.com/joallard/middleman-jon ~/.middleman/jon

### Create

    $ middleman init [foo] --template=jon
    $ cd [foo]
    $ rm README.md    # because it's annoying

## Improvements

* Make a branch for those who don't need the JS
* Make Analytics adaptable?

Corrections welcome. Enjoy!
